**My Closet**

An app created to help you remove the clutter in your closet. Tired of looking
at those items that have tags, or items that do not fit. Well we have you
covered! My Closet allows users to add their unwanted clothes such as shirts,
pants, dresses and Shoes.

The client will be able to browse the items and filter them by gender and
clothing type.

Created as the second group project for the UCSD Extension Coding Bootcamp.
